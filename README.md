# Bootstrap 4 Multiple Level Dropdown

Using official HTML without adding extra CSS styles and classes, it's just like native support. 

All things listed in https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/dropdowns/ are not effected. You can use css classes and js methods/events/options freely.

Dropdown of bootstrap can be easily changed to infinite level. It's a pity that they didn't do it.

## Usage

JustAdd js after include jquery and bootstrap js files <script src="js/bootstrap4-dropdown-ml-hack.js"></script>

## Demo

Here is a perfect demo: https://jsfiddle.net/dallaslu/adky6jvs/ (works with Bootstrap v4.4.1)
